# E-commerce Overview

**Date:** <2025-08-25>  

## 1) Key takeaways
- Revenue up **+57.6% MoM**; Orders +56.5%; **AOV** +85.8% for past 12 months.
- Revenue increase explained by Orders +14.4% MoM. AOV fell slightly (âˆ’2.4%) to $84.84, so growth was volume-driven rather than basket size expansion.

## 2) What we measured
- KPIs: Revenue, Orders, **AOV**, Margin%, GMV
- Views: `daily_revenue`, `category_margin_daily`

## 3) Actions
- Focus on customer acquisition and repeat-purchase programs(acquire more customers and convert them into repeat buyers) to lift AOV such as product bundling or free shipping threshold

## 5) Risks & next steps
- Public dataset; validate with internal data before rolling decisions.
