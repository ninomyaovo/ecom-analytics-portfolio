## 1) Key takeaways
1. Growth was **volume-driven** rather than basket-size expansion.

| Metric  | This month | Last month | MoM |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Revenue | $516,704 | $432,845 | +19.4% |
| Orders  | 6,124 | 4,872 | +25.7% |
| AOV     | $84.4 | $88.8 | −5.0% |

2. Top categories by GMV: Outerwear, Jeans, and Sweaters; Highest Margin%: Blazers for past 12 months window.

## 2) What we measured
- KPIs: Revenue, Orders, **AOV**, Margin%, GMV
- Views: `daily_revenue`, `category_margin_daily`

## 3) Actions
- Focus on customer acquisition and repeat-purchase programs(acquire more customers and convert them into repeat buyers) to lift AOV such as product bundling or free shipping threshold
- For GMV Leaders(Outerwear, Jeans, Sweaters), increase inventory depth to avoid stockouts.
- Use traffic from high-GMV categories to introduce slower-moving categories(e.g. show “Complete the look with Blazers” when someone buys jeans).

## 4) Risks & next steps
- Public dataset; validate with internal data before rolling decisions.
