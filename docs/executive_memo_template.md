# Executive Memo — E-commerce Overview (Template)

> Keep it to 1–2 pages. Aim for decisions, not details.

**Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD>  
**Analyst:** <Your Name>  
**Data Window:** <e.g., Last 12 months>

## 1) Key takeaways (3–5 bullets)
- Example: Revenue up **+8.2% MoM**; Orders +6.1%; **AOV** +2.0%.
- Example: **Pet Supplies** leads GMV (28%) with **33% margin**; opportunity for bundles.
- Example: Refund rate stable at 2.1%; no major quality red flags.

## 2) What we measured
- KPIs: Revenue, Orders, **AOV**, Margin%, GMV
- Views: `v_daily_revenue`, `v_category_margin_daily`

## 3) Insights (evidence → implication)
- **Seasonal lift in Q4**: GMV +15% vs Q3 → Prep inventory/promo calendar earlier.
- **Category mix**: Lighting has high margin% but low volume → test pricing/offers.
- **AOV drift**: AOV rising with new product bundles → consider expanding bundles.

## 4) Actions (next 30 days)
- Reallocate promo budget to top-margin categories; add two bundle SKUs.
- Launch CRM experiment for repeat buyers (free shipping threshold).
- Add category-specific landing pages for top 3 categories.

## 5) Risks & next steps
- Public dataset; validate with internal data before rolling decisions.
- Add LTV and CAC in next iteration; monitor refund rates by SKU.
